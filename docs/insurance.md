# Insurance

BMC Insurance is provided by Howden Group who have run webinars on Club Liability for Affiliated Clubs in
[2024][howden_webinar_2024] and [2026][howden_webinar_2026].

## Liability if non-members participate

- All members of the club _have_ to be members of the BMC to qualify for the insurance. _Ergo_ anyone who isn't a club
  member isn't covered. Not surprising!
- Public liability covers claims bought by a club member or a member of the public. Unclear whether non-members
  attending a club meet would be classified as "_a member of the public_". If so then I see no problem.
- In the video repeatedly use the phrase "_making claims against the club_" which suggests there is a degree or
  protection for the club as an entity as well as individual members via the policies.
- Non-climbing, non-active, i.e. social meets that are club activities are covered. This then leads to the same question
  of what has raised this issue, what if a non-club member "attends". Thus on the pub crawl you meet someone who is a
  friend who isn't a club member and they sit with the group is the club then liable? Personally I think this is pushing
  the realms of credibility.
- Important - payment isn't automatic it has to be proven that there was liability. They would have to prove that the
  club breached their responsibility. Which leads to...
- Important - it seems there is very little precedence in either civil or criminal law on which to base any of this. As
  noted in the video climbers are generally self-reliant and it is actually rare for accidents to occur and rarer that
  insurance claims are made (the exception being when life-changing injuries are incurred).

## Other aspects

- Pre-existing conditions - generally not a problem if they are taking part in "recognised activities", but it sounds as
  though there was no clear answer as it hasn't played out in courts to set a precedence.

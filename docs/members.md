# Members

The club exists for its members.

## New Members

The committee has several New Members roles, two people share the responsibility of _Membership Secretary_ for welcoming
new members and keeping on top of the administration involved with joining and renewing membership. There is also at
least one _New Member Representative_ who sits on the committee at any one time who's role it is to represent issues
that new members may experience.

### New Members Survey

To aid with assessing how the joining process works for new members Neil Shephard set up a [survey][survey] that is
periodically circulated with those who have expressed an interest in joining the club. The results are compiled into a
[report][report] which is periodically updated.

The _Membership Secretary_ will periodically circulate a link to the [survey][survey] to those who have applied to join
the club, regardless of whether they have subsequently joined or not, so that we can continue to assess how the joining
process is working and what might be done to improve the process. Neil Shephard will collate the results and update the
report bi-annually.

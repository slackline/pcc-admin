The committee uses [Signal][signal], a privacy respecting instant messaging system, to communicate.

## Adding Members to the Group

Only those who are designated as "Admin" in the group can invite new members. The current admins are...


- Neil Shephard
- Trevor Wilson
- Steve Lismore
- Adam Chambers

There are two methods of adding members to the group and which is used depends on whether you have the persons contact
phone number already.

### With Phone Number

If an admin has a persons phone number they should be able to invite them to join the group chat.

### Without Phone Number

If you don't already have a persons mobile phone number there is a link for adding people to the group which you can
send to those you wish to add to the group. To avoid SPAM this is not listed on this site, please message an admin for
this URL (Neil Shephard will definitely have it).
